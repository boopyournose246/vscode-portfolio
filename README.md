# Ramnarayanan Sankaranarayanan - Interactive Portfolio

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website, designed with an interactive interface inspired by Visual Studio Code. This project showcases my skills, experience, imagination, and projects in a unique and engaging way.

## ‚ú® Overview

This portfolio is a single-page application built with **React and plain CSS** to mimic the look and feel of the VS Code editor. It's structured to present my professional summary, work experience, education, and technical skills as if you're browsing files and content within the editor.

**The interface features:**

- A **Top Bar** with a mock search input.
- An **Activity Bar** with icons (Files, Search, Source Control, etc.).
- A **Main Panel** that includes:
  - **Tabs:** "Preview readme.md" and "index.html".
  - **Editor Panes:**
    - A "markdown preview" style pane displaying my resume details (Summary, Experience, Education, Skills).
    - An "HTML code editor" style pane showcasing contact links and project highlights.
- A **Status Bar** with typical VS Code information elements.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **React:** JavaScript library for building the user interface with components.
- **HTML5 & JSX:** For the structure and component markup.
- **CSS3:** For styling the VS Code interface, layout, and overall appearance.
  - Flexbox is used extensively for layout.
  - Custom fonts (Inter, Roboto Slab, Cascadia Code) are imported via Google Fonts.
- **Codicons:** VS Code's icon font (`@vscode/codicons`) for authentic editor icons.
- **Vite:** Frontend tooling for development server and building.
- **Node.js & npm:** For package management and running scripts.
