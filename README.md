# Ramnarayanan Sankaranarayanan - Interactive Portfolio

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website, designed with an interactive interface inspired by Visual Studio Code. This project showcases my skills, experience, and projects in a unique and engaging way.

## ✨ Overview

This portfolio is a single-page application built primarily with HTML and CSS to mimic the look and feel of the VS Code editor. It's structured to present my professional summary, work experience, education, and technical skills as if you're Browse files and content within the editor.

**The interface features:**
* A **Top Bar** with a mock search input.
* An **Activity Bar** with icons (Files, Search, Source Control, etc.).
* A **Main Panel** that includes:
    * **Tabs:** "Preview readme.md" and "index.html" to switch between content views.
    * **Editor Panes:**
        * A "markdown preview" style pane displaying my resume details (Summary, Experience, Education, Skills).
        * An "HTML code editor" style pane showcasing contact links and project highlights.
* A **Status Bar** with typical VS Code information elements.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For the structure and content of the portfolio.
* **CSS3:** For styling the VS Code interface, layout, and overall appearance.
    * Flexbox is used extensively for layout.
    * Custom fonts (Inter, Roboto Slab, Cascadia Code) are imported via Google Fonts.
* **Codicons:** VS Code's icon font (`@vscode/codicons`) for authentic editor icons.
* **Font Awesome:** For additional icons.

*(No JavaScript is directly included in the main HTML structure provided, but it could be added for further interactivity if desired.)*
